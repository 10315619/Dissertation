# dissertation_sentiment_analysis
This is a repo for my undergrade dissertation, the twitter scrape part is from https://github.com/israel-dryer/Twitter-Scraper/blob/main/twitter_scraper.py with some adjustment to fit my poor web condition, and the delta tf-idf is based on https://kgptalkie.com/amazon-and-imdb-review-sentiment-classification-using-spacy/.
